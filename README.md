This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

[!important] First, install the packages (the force flag is due to conflicted dependency packages in dnd-kit and react's 19 version):

```bash
npm i --force
```

and then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
